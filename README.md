# Claude Companion

A ChatGPT-desktop-style floating companion window for **Claude.ai** on macOS.

Press **⌥Space** (Option+Space) anywhere to summon a small floating window with
your Claude.ai account inside it. Press **⌥Space** again (or **Esc**) to dismiss it.

It's a native, lightweight AppKit app: a borderless floating `NSPanel` hosting a
`WKWebView` pointed at `claude.ai`. Because it embeds the real web app and uses a
persistent cookie store, you log in once with your normal account and stay logged in.

## Build & run

No Xcode required - just the Command Line Tools Swift toolchain.

```bash
./build.sh --install # build, install to /Applications, and launch it there
./build.sh --run     # build and (re)launch from ./build.noindex, without installing
./build.sh           # build only
```

`--install` is what makes it a real app: `/Applications` is the only location Spotlight
indexes by default, and the only one `SMAppService` will register a login item from. It
quits any running copy first - two instances would fight over the ⌥Space hot key, and
only one can win it - and re-signs after copying, since that invalidates the ad-hoc
signature.

The build directory is named `build.noindex` because macOS skips indexing directories
with that suffix. Otherwise Spotlight offers two identical "Claude Companion" entries
and you can't tell which one you're launching.

### Starting and stopping

| | |
|--|--|
| Start | Spotlight → "Claude Companion", or `open -a "Claude Companion"` |
| Stop | menu bar 🗨️ → **Quit**, or `pkill -f "MacOS/ClaudeCompanion"` |
| Start automatically at login | menu bar 🗨️ → **Start at Login** |

The app has **no Dock icon** and no ⌘Q, by design - it's a background companion, so
everything lives in the menu-bar menu.

**Editing shortcuts are handled by the window itself.** AppKit turns ⌘V into a `paste:`
action by matching it against the Edit menu's key equivalents; an app with no main menu
never gets that match, so ⌘V, ⌘C, ⌘X, ⌘A and ⌘Z are silently dropped - you can type
into Claude but not paste. `CompanionPanel.performKeyEquivalent` dispatches those
actions down the responder chain instead, which needs no menu to exist.
`claudecompanion://test-paste` exercises the real keystroke path end to end. **Start at Login** uses `SMAppService`, which
needs no helper bundle or permission prompt; if registration fails it says so in an
alert rather than silently doing nothing, and points at System Settings → General →
Login Items.

## Usage

| Action | How |
|--------|-----|
| Show / hide the window | **⌥Space** |
| Dismiss the window | **Esc** |
| Move the window | drag anywhere on it |
| Reload / New Chat / Quit | menu-bar icon |
| Stop it following the active window | menu bar → **Follow Active Window** |
| Make conversations translucent too | menu bar → **Translucent Chat** |
| Put the window back in its default spot | menu bar → **Reset Position** |
| Toggle from a script | `./toggle.sh` or `open -g "claudecompanion://toggle"` |

The URL scheme (`claudecompanion://toggle`, `://show`, `://hide`) makes the window
bindable from Raycast, Shortcuts, or Alfred.

## Architecture

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `main.swift` | Boots `NSApplication` as an accessory (menu-bar-only) app; installs an uncaught-exception logger. |
| `AppDelegate.swift` | Builds the status item, floating panel, and web view; hot key + URL-scheme actions. |
| `CompanionPanel.swift` | Borderless `NSPanel` subclass that can take keyboard focus + Esc-to-dismiss. |
| `ActiveWindow.swift` | Finds the window the user is working in, without needing any TCC permission. |
| `WebChrome.swift` | Injected CSS for the translucent, single-conversation look, plus DOM probes. |
| `PopupWindow.swift` | Real secondary window for `window.open` sign-in popups. |
| `GlobalHotKey.swift` | System-wide hot key via Carbon (no Accessibility permission needed), with fallback combos. |
| `Log.swift` | stderr + `~/Library/Logs/ClaudeCompanion.log` logging. |
| `build.sh` | Compiles with SwiftPM and assembles a signed `.app` bundle. |

### Appearance

The panel is a translucent, single-conversation view rather than the full claude.ai app:

- An `NSVisualEffectView` (`.hudWindow`, `.behindWindow`) provides the macOS blur,
  with a 22pt continuous ("squircle") corner radius and a hairline white border so the
  panel still has definition against a light backdrop.
- **The blur is clipped with `maskImage`, not just a layer `cornerRadius`.** A layer
  radius rounds the view's *contents*; the backdrop blur keeps sampling the full square
  window bounds, which paints a bright halo around the panel - very visible over a light
  background. `maskImage` masks the effect itself. The mask is a small resizable image
  with cap insets, so one image fits any panel size.
- That halo is invisible to every form of capture: `cacheDisplay` renders the hierarchy
  offscreen, and even `CGWindowListCreateImage` of the live window reports `alpha 0`
  there, because the blur is derived from a backdrop the capture doesn't contain. It can
  only be seen on screen.
- Three separate things paint an opaque backdrop, and **all** of them have to be
  cleared or the panel stays solid:
  1. `webView.underPageBackgroundColor = .clear`.
  2. `_setDrawsBackground:` - on macOS the clear `underPageBackgroundColor` above is
     *not* sufficient on its own; WKWebView keeps painting an opaque backdrop. This
     is private API, so it is probed with `responds(to:)` first and logged if absent,
     rather than risking a crash on a future macOS.
  3. CSS for `body`, `main.dframe-content`, **and** a full-bleed
     `div.pointer-events-none.absolute.inset-0` overlay that sits on top of `main`.
- The sidebar, recents, pinned lists, and app header are hidden, leaving just the
  conversation.

### Chat view

Once a conversation exists the window is only 440pt wide, so claude.ai's own chrome
needs trimming to stop it colliding with the content and the rounded corners:

- The footer disclaimer (`div.sticky.bottom-0 div.text-muted.text-center`) is hidden.
  It sits below the composer, where there is no room for it.
- The composer gets 10pt of bottom padding. Flush against the window edge, its own
  rounded box is cut by the 22pt window corners.
- Transient overlays such as "Want to be notified when Claude responds?" cover the
  reply in a window this small. They carry no stable hook, so `dismissBanners` matches
  them by text on every tick - they appear mid-response, long after load, so a
  one-shot check at load time would miss them. Two rules keep that safe:
  - **Never hide an element containing the composer.** claude.ai renders this banner
    *inside* the composer's own wrapper, so matching on text alone takes the composer
    down with it and leaves the conversation with no way to reply.
  - **The hiding is reversible.** Once the banner's text is gone the element is
    ordinary again, so the class is removed. Hiding permanently strands whatever that
    element holds next.
**The chat view uses claude.ai's own opaque dark surface by default.** Its scrims,
gradients and overlays are all drawn to fade into that surface, so they only misrender
when the page is forced transparent - a black band above the composer, gradients that
stop mid-panel. Keeping the native surface removes that whole class of defect at once,
instead of chasing each element as it appears. The compact composer bar stays
translucent either way, and **Translucent Chat** in the menu turns translucency back on
for conversations.

With translucency on, the remaining mitigations are:

- claude.ai fades the transcript out towards the composer with gradient scrims built
  for its own solid background. Over a translucent window those read as a heavy black
  band. `clearScrims` blanks them, matching on: a gradient background, at least 60% of
  the viewport wide, at least 40pt tall, and no more than 40 characters of text - the
  band contains claude.ai's "Quick answer" button, so requiring it to be empty would
  skip the element that needs clearing.
- Scrims are tagged **once**, like `.cc-surface`. The rule blanks the gradient, so
  re-evaluating would find no gradient, untag it, and flip forever.
- The sweep checks `::before` and `::after` as well as the element itself. A fade is
  commonly drawn with `before:bg-gradient-*`, which `getComputedStyle(el)` does not
  report - so an element-only check is blind to exactly the scrims that matter.
- The default scrollbar is replaced with a 6pt translucent one.

### Compact mode

With no conversation open, the window collapses to **just the composer** - no greeting,
no icons, no empty space - and expands to full height once a conversation starts, like
the ChatGPT companion.

- The composer is isolated **structurally**: every sibling along its ancestor chain is
  hidden (`WebChrome.layoutJS`). The chain is something the DOM guarantees; the
  Tailwind class names on the greeting and header are not, so hiding by name would be
  the fragile choice.
- **The walk stops at `<main>`.** Above `main` is the app's layout scaffolding,
  including a CSS Grid. Hiding an item inside that grid removes it from grid layout,
  which re-places the surviving item into a content-sized row - and since `main` is
  absolutely positioned and contributes no height, that row collapses to zero,
  taking the whole subtree with it. The result renders *nothing* while still
  reporting a correct 120pt composer rect.
- **No layout overrides on the wrappers.** They aren't needed: once the window is
  only as tall as the composer, `h-screen` is that height too, so the page's own
  layout already fits. Forcing `height: auto` on them collapses `main` to 0x0 and
  every `w-full` descendant with it.
- The page reports the composer's height over a `WKScriptMessageHandler`, and the panel
  resizes to `height + 20`. Its bottom edge stays planted (in Cocoa `origin.y` *is* the
  bottom edge), so it grows upward from its resting position instead of drifting.
- Mode follows the URL: claude.ai uses `/new` until a conversation exists, then
  `/chat/<id>`. Because it's a single-page app, the script polls every 400ms rather
  than relying on load events.
- The isolation re-runs every tick and clears the chain first. claude.ai is a React
  app that replaces subtrees, so an element hidden during an earlier pass can end up
  on the composer's current chain and hide the composer permanently.

**The window frame is the composer's frame.** claude.ai paints its own opaque rounded
panel inside the composer; left alone, that reads as a box inside a box - two borders,
two radii, and the blur reduced to a thin gutter. The compact stylesheet strips that
panel's background, border, radius, and shadow (`.cc-surface`), and `compactPadding` is
`0`, so what you see is a single translucent bar like the ChatGPT companion.

Two feedback loops had to be closed to make this stable, both of the same shape - an
effect that changes its own input:

- `.cc-surface` is tagged **once**. The tag goes to the largest element painting a
  background; making it transparent means it no longer qualifies, so re-evaluating each
  tick moves the tag away, the background returns, and the composer's height flips
  between 118 and 120pt forever.
- `setPanelHeight` ignores changes under `heightTolerance` (5pt). Resizing the window
  re-lays out the page and can shift the measured height by a point or two. A wrapped
  line of text is far larger than the deadband, so real growth still gets through.

```
layout compact: composer 120pt -> panel 140pt
health check: ... compact=true viewport=140 composer=10..130 fits
stray elements: no stray elements
```

## Diagnosing the page

Geometry logs report correct rects **whether or not anything was painted**, so they
cannot tell a layout bug from a rendering one. These two commands can:

```bash
./check.sh                              # inspect the live DOM right now
open -g "claudecompanion://snapshot"    # write what is actually drawn to /tmp
```

`snapshot` writes two PNGs, which separate the layers:

- `/tmp/cc-web.png` - what the *page* renders (via `WKWebView.takeSnapshot`)
- `/tmp/cc-window.png` - the view hierarchy drawn offscreen (`cacheDisplay`)

Neither shows what the **window server** actually composites, so neither can reveal
edge or corner artefacts - `cacheDisplay` renders the same picture whether or not the
defect is present. `claudecompanion://screengrab` captures the real window instead:

- `/tmp/cc-screen.png` - the window's own pixels
- `/tmp/cc-screen-framed.png` - including shadow and framing

Sample the corner pixels rather than trusting the image: transparency renders as white
in most viewers, which looks identical to a white artefact.

`check` logs the injected-style state, the composer's full ancestor chain with each
element's computed size/overflow/position, and any stray chrome floating outside the
composer (the floating "Open sidebar" trigger is a separate `<aside>` that outlives
the sidebar panel itself). `CLAUDE_COMPANION_NO_COMPACT=1` runs the app with compact mode off, to get a
baseline of the page's untouched layout to compare against.

The CSS targets selectors read off the **live authenticated DOM** rather than guesses -
`WebChrome.probeJS` / `backgroundProbeJS` dump the page's landmarks and computed
backgrounds to the log when the app runs with `CLAUDE_COMPANION_PROBE=1`. That probe
showed only `body` (`rgb(21,21,21)`) and `main.dframe-content` paint an opaque backdrop;
every wrapper between them is already transparent.

Because claude.ai can change its markup at any time, `WebChrome.verifyJS` re-reads the
computed styles after each load and logs the result, so a silently-failed injection
shows up as a log line instead of a mysteriously opaque window:

```
style check: style injected=true body bg=rgba(0, 0, 0, 0) main bg=rgba(0, 0, 0, 0) \
    sidebar display=none large-opaque-elements=0
```

`large-opaque-elements` counts anything still painting over 20% of the viewport, which
is the single most useful signal that translucency has broken. It earned its keep
immediately: it caught the injection failing completely when a CSS *comment* containing
backticks terminated the JavaScript template literal the stylesheet was interpolated
into. The CSS is now passed through `jsStringLiteral` (JSON-encoded) so no CSS content
can break the injection script.

### Window position

The window rests **horizontally centred on the screen, 20pt above the Dock** - the spot
macOS companion utilities like Wispr Flow use: close to hand, without covering what
you're reading.

The window you're working in decides *which display* it appears on, so it follows you
across monitors - but not where on that display. Placement is the same screen-centred
spot regardless, which is what makes it predictable rather than jumping around with
whatever window happens to be focused.

How the active window is found (`ActiveWindow.swift`):

- `CGWindowListCopyWindowInfo` reports window geometry and owning process **without
  needing the Accessibility or Screen Recording permission** - only window *titles*
  and *images* are gated by those. The `AXUIElement` API would work too but costs the
  user a permission prompt.
- The frontmost app is tracked continuously via
  `NSWorkspace.didActivateApplicationNotification`, because showing the panel
  activates *us* - by the time the hot key fires, the app the user was working in is
  no longer frontmost.
- Windows belonging to full-screen apps on **other Spaces** are reported at parked
  coordinates outside the real display arrangement (several unrelated apps share one
  bogus origin), so any window that doesn't land on a real `NSScreen` is skipped.
- Core Graphics window bounds are y-down from the primary display's top-left; Cocoa
  is y-up from its bottom-left, so bounds are converted before use.
- The result uses the target screen's `visibleFrame`, so the window is always fully
  visible and above the Dock.

Fallbacks, in order: active window's screen → screen under the pointer → `NSScreen.main`.

Turn this off with **Follow Active Window** in the menu, and the window instead
reappears wherever you last dragged it (remembered across relaunches, and ignored if
that spot belongs to a monitor you've since unplugged). **Reset Position** clears it.

### Hot key handling

A combo can only be owned by one process at a time - `RegisterEventHotKey` returns
`eventHotKeyExistsErr` (-9878) to the loser. The ChatGPT desktop app claims
**⌥Space**, so the app tries a chain of combos and keeps the first one macOS grants:

⌥Space → ⌘⌥Space → ⌃⌥Space → ⌥C → ⌘⌥C

Whichever it got is shown in the menu-bar menu, and logged at startup.

## Troubleshooting

Check the log first - startup, hot key registration, navigation, and show/hide are
all recorded:

```bash
tail -20 ~/Library/Logs/ClaudeCompanion.log
```

If the shortcut does nothing, the menu-bar menu will tell you which combo is live
(another app may have taken ⌥Space). `./toggle.sh` always works regardless.

## Known limitations (v0.1 POC)

- **Google "Sign in with Google"** can be blocked inside embedded web views by
  Google's security checks. Email / magic-link login works reliably.
- Hot key list and window width are fixed (no settings UI yet).
- The injected CSS depends on claude.ai's markup (`[data-testid="sidebar"]`,
  `[data-testid="chat-input"]`, `main.dframe-content`). If Anthropic renames those,
  the sidebar reappears or compact mode stops working - the `style check` log line is
  how you'd spot it.

## Bugs found and fixed during the first POC

- **Silent startup failure.** Setting both `.canJoinAllSpaces` and
  `.moveToActiveSpace` on `collectionBehavior` is invalid (mutually exclusive) and
  raised an ObjC exception that AppKit swallowed. It aborted panel construction
  *and* hot key registration, so ⌥Space did nothing. Fixed, plus
  `NSSetUncaughtExceptionHandler` so this class of failure is never invisible again.
- **Ignored `OSStatus`.** Hot key registration failures were discarded. Now checked,
  logged, and recovered from via the fallback chain.
- **Private-API KVC hack.** `setValue(false, forKey: "drawsBackground")` on
  `WKWebView` has no such setter; replaced with the public `underPageBackgroundColor`.
